# what is this OwO
a test project for me to see how creative i can be with windows console and the place cursor function
so uh basically you can create a FPS game with this console i found some dude's project on the internet

the only limit is that you have to print a character and each character has the same dimension, apparently to me you are not able to free form drawing pixels, that's strong enough i guess?


this is a simple program that displays a programming problem, for data each problem has a testcases folder and a problem statement, when you hit submit, you will be prompted to select a (Windows) executable within the same folder of the problem you are trying to solve, then its just simple string matching

# how does this work????
every folders P#XXXX contains statement and testcases

the program loads all the statements and show it to you on the terminal

select one and hit Enter to submit your (Windows) EXECUTABLE so the program can cross-checking your output

there is more, you can add Programming Problem Statement and testcases by, guess what, creating folders and textfiles. wow i know.

also if you write an executable that output the answer file of the problem you are an asshole
